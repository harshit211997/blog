So, today is Indepence day! Yay! So, first of all, happy independence day to all!(Although I am quite sure that no one would be reading this post, happens for every noobies). 

Well, this blog can be about many things, that I have experienced recently. But, depending on how long it continues to interest me and also, depending on the amount of sleep that I experience during the typing of this blog(I am at labs of my college, IIT Roorkee). 

Starting with the most recent blog that I read from gamasutra, I have to say that I was very inspired from the idea of "game a week", in which you have to create a new game every week and do not have to revisit it afterwards. As being said in another blog that I read(from gamasutra only), the game experience you acquire, depends on the no. of games that you make, not on the scale of the game itself. It cites an example of an experiment that was conducted on a group of students(If I remember correctly), in which, the group was divided into two parts, each given the same task of make a perfect(or close to that) pot. The difference being that the first group was told that they get only one chance of making the pot, but they can read about it as many times as they want. However, the second group was told that they can't read about making a pot but they have to make and break a pot every week. Obviously, the second group made the better pot. (Now, that I think about it, it was an experiment more about experimenting).

So, continuing, I have decided to start documenting the game a week in this blog. Although, there will be some discontinuity in the beginning. That is partly because, I have a habit of starting something slow(So, that I do not leave the habit too early), and partly because I have many things to do in the coming weeks, like code.fun.do(A competition organised by Microsoft in my college), and the mid term exams ofcourse. Another reason is that I

You must be thinking, how can a sentence end with an I, wanna know, it's easy, when you discontinue!(I had to leave the lab and now I am in my hostel room, typing with full speed again). So, I was talking about more reasons for discontinuing _the game a week_. See, even when I haven't started it, so many excuses have already shown their faces.

I have been doing two games nowadays, one is Splitter, and JustDive. I won't go into the details of them now, but, Splitter is almost complete and JustDive is just started. So, my first target is to finish(or just try to finish) the game. I am fairly excited about this project(as I am for almost anything). Let's see how it goes.
