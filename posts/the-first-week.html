          <div class="article-content">
            <p>I would like to clarify one thing. I got the idea of game a week on 26th and today is 29th, so, it is less than a week. Although, I was working on the game for much before than that, so I thought, today should be it for my next blog.(The actual reason is that the game was not so good enough to keep me motivated enough so that I could complete it :P).</p>

<p>Let me first talk a little bit about the game I made.
<em>Name</em> - Just Dive!
<em>Github Link</em> - (to be filled soon!)</p>

<p>The game was about a person who has nothing to in the world except to dive in the water. So, he keeps diving in water, and us(the players), the morons, keep judging him if he was doing it right(We do this a lot in our society, and even I do it, maybe because I am a part of the society). Goal is to dive head first or legs first, and not on stomach or back.</p>

<p>So, as customary(for game a week), let me discuss about main topics :</p>

<h3 id="what-i-expected-to-learn">What I expected to learn</h3>

<p>Well, quite honestly, I only started to make this game because I didn’t quite understand how the player was so gracefully able to do such human like movements in Flip diving(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.motionvolt.flipdiving). <em>ho!, I just told that my idea was a copied one, not original. But, it doesn’t matter, Pablo Picasso once said, ‘Good artists copy, but Great artists steal’. So, at least I am a good artist.(Yeah, game development is more art than coding)</em></p>

<h3 id="what-i-actually-learnt">What I actually learnt</h3>

<p>I was able to make the basic jump, dive and jumping animations in blender(A 3D modelling software), following a tutorial(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGvalWG8HBU). I used the same model as used in the tutorial, so, no learning there! So, basically I learnt how do complex animation system work in unity(mecanim, the saviour).</p>

<p>Another more important thing to learn while making the game is that while making things that requires patience, you must love what you are going to make, or it will turn out to be a total disaster.(As in my case, the game is just hanging between ‘bad game’ and ‘worst game ever’)</p>

<h3 id="what-i-wish-to-improve">What I wish to improve</h3>

<p>It always happens that when I get a great idea, and I start working on it, it turns out to be not so great. But, the interesting thing is that, even then(subconsciously) I do wish to accept that. I focus on completing it, which is another good skill, but I need to keep a balance.</p>

<p>I learnt one more thing, always make things close to yourself(if you are like me and not so creative). You know about yourself. So, you can use that in your creations. You will be surprised to see the depth of your personality, which we fail to notice in our everyday lives.</p>

<p>I would like to share one last thing. I already got an idea for the next week! I won’t disclose it now, you’ll have to wait for that. But one thing, this a an original idea, and close to my heart.</p>
